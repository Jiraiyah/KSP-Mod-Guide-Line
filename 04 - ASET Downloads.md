Normally I would put these inside the part file structure and group. But ASET is so important that I decided it needs it's own file. There are some files here that will sit between quality of life and part files. The reason is that they have the spice of beuty but at the same time, they are not MUST HAVE and people can go without them. personally, I think there is no way I would play a game without any of these.
