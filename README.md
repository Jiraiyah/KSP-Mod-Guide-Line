## Module Manager

## Visual Mods
I get them first for multiple reasons :
1- They may not work properly with early releasing time, trying and failing on them, better to find about it at the start with smaller loading time.
2- They eat memory, on machines with limited memory, it's better to handle them first to find how much memory left for other things
